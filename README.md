# Weather-App

An attempt at using OpenWeatherMap API with pure HTML and vanilla Javascript - it's been great practice for me to go back to vanilla JS after my bootcamp and try and get a better understanding of how HTML & JS work together, before using a framework like React...

It seems the icons I wanted to use have been depracated, I will find another source at some point, as DarkSkyAPI and icons are unavailable.

Feel free to comment if I have missed anything or you see any code that could be refactored, I''m still learning!
